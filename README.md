# Gainzz - Workout Planning App

## Description

This website serves as practice for creating a full-stack MERN (Mongo Express React Node) application. In this project I use React and MongoDB to create an application with user login credentials and workout creation and population functionality through back-end database interaction. You can register and login as a user, create your own exercises, and plan your workouts with details such as reps, sets, and weights.
